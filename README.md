# Drum Remover

## Personal website for my father so we can easily remove the drums from songs so he can drum along himself

### Uses yt-dlp to download audio from YouTube links

### Uses Spleeter to separate the drums from the rest of the audio

You just type the name of the song you want, it will then search and display some options. Then you pick one and it will seperate and remove the drums. 

Youll also notice the history log. If you want to go back a song you can click on those as you see fit.
